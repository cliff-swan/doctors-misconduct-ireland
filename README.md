The purpose of this repository is to serve as a single tabulated source of the doctors who were involved in misconduct cases as listed on the Irish Medical Council website for the years from 2008 to 2023. 

The tabulated list is shown in the csv file in this repository. There are several duplicates listed on the Irish Medical Council website, these have been removed from this list. 

The country of origin for the doctors is based on media reports or the findings from the Irish Medical Council pdf, both of which are in the last column. 

Where there is no clear information on this and they have atypical names, as is the case for three individuals, then "Other non-Irish" is used.

The source for the information is here: https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/public-information/inquiry-notifications/fitness-to-practise-notifications/fitness-to-practise-inquiry-notifications-.html
