**12/03/24** I will continue to update the list from information released by the Irish Medical Council. Some which were listed in 2023 have been moved to 2024 as their cases have just finished in the courts.

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a single tabulated source of the doctors who were involved in misconduct cases as listed on the Irish Medical Council website for the years from 2008 to 2023. 

The tabulated list is shown in the csv file in this repository. There are several duplicates listed on the Irish Medical Council website, these have been removed from this list. 

The country of origin for the doctors is based on media reports or the findings from the Irish Medical Council pdf, both of which are in the last column. 

Where there is no clear information on this and they have atypical names, as is the case for three individuals, then "Other non-Irish" is used.

From this I find that over 80% of the cases listed involve a non-Irish doctor. When migrant doctors themselves represent 40% of the doctors in Ireland.

In 2011, the figure reported was 60% of cases involving a foreign doctor: https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-20141083.html

Addendum 14/02/2024:
Owing to the popularity of this information on X it has been brought to my attention that the situation in the UK is not much better. By analysing Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service cases, Dr. Andrew Joyce has found that foreign doctors account for at least 80% of the cases brought before the tribunal. Here is a quote:

"Ignored by the mainstream media, I took it upon myself to conduct an analysis of the MPTS’s list of tribunal decisions — an analysis which revealed that non-British doctors (25% of the total) are responsible for at least 80% of tribunal cases, the vast majority of them bearing Muslim, South Asian, or African names (interestingly, Jewish physicians are also over-represented relative to their share of the UK population)."

Interestingly, this doesnt differ much from an article in the Telegraph from 2012 which found 3/4 of malpractice cases involved a foreign trained doctor: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9771022/Revealed-3-in-4-of-Britains-danger-doctors-are-trained-abroad.html
